# Hello, how are you?

## Me

I am Lucas, a Bachelor in Information Systems, deeply passionate about Computing and the art of solving real-world problems through technology. I have professional experience in web and mobile development, focusing on building modern, scalable, and well-structured applications.

My background also includes good knowledge in Data Science, with a strong interest in data analysis, data processing, and data-driven decision-making. I am particularly drawn to areas such as Machine Learning, intelligent systems, and IOT, where data, automation, and innovation converge to create impactful solutions.

I strongly value software engineering best practices, applying principles such as SOLID, Clean Code, and design patterns, alongside automated testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD). My goal is always to deliver software that is robust, maintainable, and capable of evolving over time.

Additionally, I have experience working with messaging systems and event-driven architectures, enabling the development of decoupled, resilient, and scalable systems.

Beyond industry experience, I have a strong interest in academic development and research. I aspire to pursue a postgraduate degree, combining scientific research, innovation, and professional practice to deepen my expertise and contribute to the advancement of computing.

I am continuously seeking new challenges and learning opportunities that allow me to grow both as a software engineer and as a researcher in the field of Computer Science.
